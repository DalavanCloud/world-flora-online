It can become a noxious weed locally and has the potential to establish reproducing populations when introduced into suitable habitats. It has been introduced in California and in Australia, but apparently has been successfully eradicated in both areas (Jepson Flora Project 2014; eFloraSA 2014). The California Department of Food and Agriculture rates S. dimidiatum under category 'A' as ""a pest of known...environmental detriment"" (CDFA 2014).

We have chosen here to assign it to Endangered, a less severe category for three reasons: the species occurs in more than one location, it is known from within a effectively protected area (Parque Estadual do Ibitipoca), and the other location where it is found is somewhat remote. Nevertheless, Solanum kriegeri is from a very specific habitat in well-preserved forest fragments and monitoring its populations is strongly recommended.

The extent of occupancy is estimated to be approximately 10, 000 km<sup>2</sup> and less than five collected locations. This area of the Amotape-Huancabamba Zone has been underexplored, but collections have increased in recent years, largely due to efforts by MO in southern Ecuador and HAO in northern Peru. As this collecting continues and more specimens are determined in herbaria the number of locations should rise. Additionally, although there is continuing decline in forest habitat in this region due to deforestation for the establishment of settlements and farming, the effects of this on Solanum rubicaule are difficult to assess because it occurs in disturbed edges of forest and roadsides. Sicne its description the range of S. rubicaule has been extended to central Peru, but it is still not common. </p>"		http://solanaceaesource.org/content/solanum-rubicaule		Solanaceae Source	eng	http://rs.tdwg.org/ontology/voc/SPMInfoItems#ConservationStatus	text/html	http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/Text	4370f824-74f6-4245-841d-2954ff554e63	http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/	5d943b63-a590-48ee-9cf0-b4b0f8b580b0#conservation	3e1b969c-c7ca-4a84-970e-d0caae476421

Although the species is known to occur in three protected areas [Área de Preservação Ambiental Serra da Mantiqueira (APA Mantiqueira), Parque Estadual de Campos do Jordão and Parque Nacional de Itatiaia] we suggest to maintain it as Endangered due to: the effectiveness of APAs in protecting the species is doubtful, the Parque Estadual de Campos do Jordão have considerable areas with exotic species, and both it and Parque Nacional do Itatiaia have considerable areas with habitats not suitable to Solanum bradei (such as outcrops and highland grassfields). Although Solanum bradei is known to grow on secondary fragments and in a wide elevation range, threats to it are clear, considering that the southern Mantiqueira range, where most collections are from, is situated between the two main urban centers in Brazil and has become a tourism hub. In addition, over the past few decades the montane forests and the highland fields of Mantiqueira have been increasingly converted to pastures, monocultures or urban centers.</p>"		http://solanaceaesource.org/content/solanum-bradei		Solanaceae Source	eng	http://rs.tdwg.org/ontology/voc/SPMInfoItems#ConservationStatus	text/html	http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/Text	4370f824-74f6-4245-841d-2954ff554e63	http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/	8c56a091-4eda-4f87-b102-cb20a3751deb#conservation	6fdaabd0-320d-4289-a0c0-4a63ee374408

wfo-0001028033	conservation	"<p>(IUCN, 2013). Critically Endangered (CR) B1; B2 ab (iii, iv). Solanum friburgense is known from two localities closely situated to each other within the same municipality, that represents an AOO of 8 km2. The type specimen was collected in 1990 and despite an intensive inventory that was recently carried out in the area (Lima and Guedes-Bruni 1997), no additional collections were made until 2009. Although the EOO could not be calculated because only two points are available, if the species is actually endemic to Nova Friburgo and surroundings it would probably fit the Critically Endangered category (less than 100 km2 ). Even considering the occurrence within two conservation units and the paucity of material available for analysis, we provisionally suggest it to be assessed as Critically Endangered, regarding it seems to have a reproductive system based on vegetative propagation (see Discussion below). Within RPPN Bacchus two large populations are known (about 50 individuals), but no flowering specimens were observed in the field over three consecutive years (2009, 2010 and 2011).</p>"		http://solanaceaesource.org/content/solanum-friburgense		Solanaceae Source	eng	http://rs.tdwg.org/ontology/voc/SPMInfoItems#ConservationStatus	text/html	http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/Text	4370f824-74f6-4245-841d-2954ff554e63	http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/	03c601aa-5fdd-4be1-ba2d-2bed6f187d4b#conservation	7c0a0dc3-3105-4fbc-a702-8a2264dae96d
wfo-0001028033	distribution	"<p>Narrowly endemic in southern Brazil, known from only two localities in the municipality of Nova Friburgo in the state of Rio de Janeiro. Both localities are within conservation units, one public (Reserva Ecológica de Macaé de Cima) and one private (RPPN Bacchus). Rare in the understory of well-preserved fragments of the Brazilian Atlantic coastal rainforest, at elevations of about 1, 500 m. The species always shows a well-developed rhizome system. This suggests the plant invests heavily in vegetative propagation, which is consistent with the few flowering specimens found in the field. In cultivation, so few flowers were produced that no crossing studies were performed.</p>"		http://solanaceaesource.org/content/solanum-friburgense		Solanaceae Source	eng	http://rs.tdwg.org/ontology/voc/SPMInfoItems#Distribution	text/html	http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/Text	4370f824-74f6-4245-841d-2954ff554e63	http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/	03c601aa-5fdd-4be1-ba2d-2bed6f187d4b#distribution	7c0a0dc3-3105-4fbc-a702-8a2264dae96d

wfo-0001027276	conservation	"<p>Based on IUCN Red List Categories (IUCN 2011), Solanum cowiei is considered Data Deficient (DD). The species is relatively widespread, occurring over a geographic range of over 800 km, but it has been collected in fewer than 10 localities. The small number of collections, coupled with the fact that populations outside of Litchfield National Park were only confirmed within the last several years, suggest that the species is common in some localities but uncommon on the regional and global scales. The clonal nature of the species is worth considering, as “populations” of Solanum cowiei often appear to be large multi-stemmed genets connected by an underground network of stolons. Because the species is dioecious, individual genets cannot self-fertilize, leading to the potential for reproductively isolated clonal individuals. Further data are required before a certain conservation status can be determined. Key populations are protected in Litchfield, Limmen and Keep River National Parks and appear secure given current fire management regimes.</p>"		http://solanaceaesource.org/content/solanum-cowiei		Solanaceae Source	eng	http://rs.tdwg.org/ontology/voc/SPMInfoItems#ConservationStatus	text/html	http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/Text	4370f824-74f6-4245-841d-2954ff554e63	http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/	aa45203e-91b6-4d56-b12f-6d7abae3b24d#conservation	7e85534f-ee7e-4dbd-8983-5cd714706d2f

The areas where Solanum cowiei has been collected are fire-prone and burn at semi-regular intervals, allowing for this taxon to compete effectively with species of lesser fire tolerance. </p>"		http://solanaceaesource.org/content/solanum-cowiei		Solanaceae Source	eng	http://rs.tdwg.org/ontology/voc/SPMInfoItems#Distribution	text/html	http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/Text	4370f824-74f6-4245-841d-2954ff554e63	http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/	aa45203e-91b6-4d56-b12f-6d7abae3b24d#distribution	7e85534f-ee7e-4dbd-8983-5cd714706d2f

wfo-0001032453	use	"<p>cannibal's tomato (English); boro-dina (Fiji); poro-poro (Tahiti)</p><br/><p>Used as food for both fruits and leaves; Use of S. viride during cannibal feasts in Fiji has lead to a general macabre fascination with the species, and provided it with the English common name “Cannibal's Tomato.” Several authors wrote about the use of S. viride. The most extensive reports were provided by Seemann (1862, 1865–73) and Brewster (1922). According to Seemann (1862, 1865–73), the Fijians believed human flesh or “boloka” as they called it was difficult to digest and could cause constipation lasting two to three days or result in death. Apparently to aid in digestion, the leaves of three species, Trophis anthropophagorum Seem. (Moraceae), Omalanthus [sic Homalanthus] pedicellatus Benth. (Euphorbiaceae), and S. viride, were always eaten as a condiment being wrapped around the flesh before cooking (Seemann, 1862, 1865–73). The Fijians name for S. viride was boro dina (Seemann, 1862, 1865–73), sometimes spelled mboro ndina (Brewster, 1922); it is translated as “true spinach” (Brewster, 1922). To insure a regular and fresh supply, Solanum viride was grown next to the Bure-ni-sa or “stranger’s house” where the bodies were brought prior to consumption (Seemann, 1862, 1865–73). The fruits of S. viride are described as having a faint aromatic smell (Brewster, 1922; Seemann, 1862, 1865–73) and were occasionally made into a “tomato sauce.” The last documented act of cannibalism in which S. viride was used occurred in July 1867 when the Reverend Thomas Baker, a British missionary, was eaten (Brewster, 1922). However, there is no reason to believe that S. viride was not used in subsequent cannibal activities extending through 1874. In Fiji, Solanum viride was also utilized by white settlers (Brewster, 1922; Seemann, 1862, 1865–73) presumably with a different main course.</p><br/><p>Besides uses as food, the leaves of S. viride are used medicinally in Tonga (Whistler, 1991), and the decorative fruits are made into crowns in the Society Islands (Papy, 1955) and garlands on Niue (<em>Yuncker 10039</em>).</p>"		http://solanaceaesource.org/content/solanum-viride		Solanaceae Source	eng	http://rs.tdwg.org/ontology/voc/SPMInfoItems#Use	text/html	http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/Text	4370f824-74f6-4245-841d-2954ff554e63	http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/	0dea4679-bcb5-4015-a44f-ae5e5537a024#use	a572f468-09f7-4ce8-a53d-4638fd780bea

There are only sporadic collections from Asia since the type of<i> S. khasianum</i> was collected in 1847–1851. It is significant that when Sen Gupta published <i>S. khasianum</i> var. <i>chatterjeeanum</i> (= <i>S. viarum</i>) in 1971, he already had more collections of his new variety than of <i>S. khasianum</i> var. <i>khasianum</i> (=<i>S. aculeatissimum</i>). He had access to the larger Indian herbaria, but all seven collections of var. <i>khasianum</i> were from Assam State and all were collected in the period of 1850–1900. <i>Solanum viarum</i> is almost certainly a very recent introduction to Asia, perhaps mostly during the Second World War (Babu, 1971), although there is a collection from West Bengal dated 1932 (<i>Parker 3195</i>). While this latter species is fast becoming a common and widespread weed,it is possible that <i>S. aculeatissimum</i> was introduced during the early colonial period from Africa and has not been able to successfully establish itself.</p>"		http://solanaceaesource.org/content/solanum-aculeatissimum		Solanaceae Source	eng	http://rs.tdwg.org/ontology/voc/SPMInfoItems#Distribution	text/html	http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/Text	4370f824-74f6-4245-841d-2954ff554e63	http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/	9a1097d4-3caa-4eea-a16c-1c6cd64bbbdb#distribution	acc370f2-1c93-41c2-8989-fc4255bf1214

Frequent in thickets of secondary-growth vegetation, along roadsides and fields and in other disturbed habitats, as well as in forest openings and along riverbanks.</p><br/><p>Solanum erianthum is native to North and Central America and is apparently rare in northern South America. It is adventive in India, China, the East Indies, and Australia. It was possibly introduced to the Philippines and thence to China, and elsewhere during the Spanish Galleon trade from Mexico, which commenced in the 16th century.</p><br/><p>Solanum erianthum occurs in many vegetation zones, from humid lowland evergreen tropics near sea level to dry Acacia-cactus thorn-scrub and, at higher altitudes (to 2000 m) in Pinus-Quercus forests.

wfo-0001026490	conservation	"<p>According to the IUCN Red List Categories (IUCN 2011), Solanum baretiae is classified as Data Deficient (DD). Although Solanum baretiae occurs over a broad geographic range (> 60, 000 km2), it has been collected at fewer than 10 localities (localities within a few kilometers of each other have been grouped for this assessment) and from a narrow elevational band within its range. The relatively small number of collections of this species suggests that it is rare in the habitats where it occurs. Furthermore, these localities are near expanding population centers and habitats in these areas are highly fragmented and degraded. Nevertheless, Solanum baretiae seems to be well suited to habitat change caused by human activities, since EJT and LB observed thriving populations along roadsides and among shrubs between the town of Guzmango (Dept. Cajamarca, Peru) and the cultivated and pasture lands that surround the town. Further data regarding the distribution and abundance of Solanum baretiae are needed before we can make a more solid assessment of its conservation status.</p>"		http://solanaceaesource.org/content/solanum-baretiae		Solanaceae Source	eng	http://rs.tdwg.org/ontology/voc/SPMInfoItems#ConservationStatus	text/html	http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/Text	4370f824-74f6-4245-841d-2954ff554e63	http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/	7fb3cbd3-907a-4887-a4df-927867a6c723#conservation	d3788866-31ce-4b13-aacf-b1ebcf359702

Solanum anisocladum is known from only three localities and its calculated extent of occurrence using the MCP is 834 km<sup>2</sup>. Despite the fact that the Bahia registry is far from the one in Pernambuco state, the MCP reflects the narrow range of coastal rainforest where the species is expected to occur. Although the type locality is now part of a private reserve owned by a sugar company (RPPN Frei Caneca), it consists of a small group of forest fragments in a severely damaged landscape mainly modified by extensive agriculture based on monoculture (plantations). Generally, the Atlantic coastal rainforest has been severely damaged in northeastern Brazil in the past decades due to urban expansion and extensive farming.</p>"		http://solanaceaesource.org/content/solanum-anisocladum		Solanaceae Source	eng	http://rs.tdwg.org/ontology/voc/SPMInfoItems#ConservationStatus	text/html	http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/Text	4370f824-74f6-4245-841d-2954ff554e63	http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/	234b7f29-edcf-4c2c-a621-877295b01f18#conservation	fa113b8b-90cb-4f9a-ad52-91981551ccf7
